## Overview:
Marketers struggle to allocate budgets effectively due to uncertainty about customer behavior.
Misallocations lead to wasted resources and missed revenue opportunities. 
By predicting customer conversions, this project seeks to minimize these inefficiencies and guide data-driven decision-making for better campaign outcomes.
Additionally, we developed a Power BI dashboard to further analyze campaign conversion prediction results and provide interactive visualizations for stakeholders.

## Problem Statement:
The Objective of this project are as follows:
1. Develop a robust predictive model: Accurately predict whether a customer will convert based on demographic and engagement features.
2. Optimize marketing strategies: Improve campaign targeting, increase conversion rates, and maximize return on advertising spend (ROAS).

## Dataset Description:
- 8000 rows and 20 columns
- Attributes include Demographic Information, Marketing Specific Variables, Customer Engagement Variables, Historical Variables and Conversion ( Converted for 1 and 0 for not )
